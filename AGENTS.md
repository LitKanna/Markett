## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Copy style (hard rule)
Never use em dashes (`-`) anywhere on the website or in storefront/admin UI copy.
Prefer a period, comma, colon, or hyphen (`-`) instead. Same for docs you add to this repo
when they are user-facing; avoid reintroducing `-` in `index.html`, `app.js`, or Worker
`ADMIN_HTML` strings.

### What this repo is
YOLKO (`Markett`) is a single **static, one-page marketing/ordering website** for selling
fresh egg trays. The core files are `index.html`, `styles-modern.css`, `app.js`, and `config.js`.
There is **no framework and no build step**. The files are served as-is.

### Run the site (the main product)
From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080. No install is required just to view/use the site.

### Viewport fit (non-obvious)
`index.html` measures `visualViewport` (Chrome / Safari / iOS browser chrome) into
`--vvh` / `--app-height` before paint. Hero/showcase CSS uses `--frame-h` from that,
not raw `svh`/`dvh` alone. Chalk-tray heroes are **1:1**. keep `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`
on `.showcase-card` (do not revert to `3/4`). After Worker deploys, bump
`X-Yolko-Build` and keep `CHALK_ASSETS_SHA` so the hero does not 404 black.

### Ordering flow works fully client-side (non-obvious)
`app.js` sets `API_BASE` to `https://getyolko.com` whenever the site is **not** served from a
`getyolko.com` host (i.e. always in local dev). The `/api/*` calls (`settings`, `orders`,
`checkout`) therefore hit production and fail silently in local dev. The booking flow
(fill form → **Reserve** → confirmation receipt with WhatsApp link) degrades gracefully and
works end-to-end locally **without** any backend. Use the "Reserve" button (not "Buy now") to
demonstrate the flow without needing Stripe.

### Optional backend (not needed to run/demo the site)
`infra/cloudflare-worker.mjs` is a Cloudflare Worker (config in `wrangler.toml`) providing
`/api/*` and an `/admin` dashboard. Run with `npx wrangler dev` (defaults to port 8787). It
needs a KV namespace bound as `DATA` (wrangler dev provides a local simulation) plus
`ADMIN_KEY` and `STRIPE_KEY` secrets; Stripe endpoints return 503 when `STRIPE_KEY` is unset.
`wrangler` is intentionally not a declared dependency. invoke via `npx`.

Admin **Waiting** auto-archives unpaid orders whose Saturday delivery date
(`pickupDate` like `25 Jul`) is already past in Australia/Sydney. Status becomes
`cancelled` with `archiveReason: "expired_unpaid"`. Full customer fields stay on
the order; the **Customers** panel includes cancelled/expired contacts (name,
phone, email, address). Future unpaid dates stay in Waiting. Runs on
`GET /api/orders` and the 15m cron.

### No lint / test / build tooling
There is no ESLint/Prettier/Ruff or test framework configured. `npm test` is a placeholder
that intentionally fails (`echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1`). do not treat that as
a real failure. `.github/workflows/` handles GitHub Pages + Worker deploys only.

### Other tooling (optional, ops-only)
- `infra/*.py` image generators need `pip install -r requirements.txt` (opencv, Pillow).
- `infra/meta-*.mjs` Meta ad automation uses Playwright (installed via `npm install`) and
  requires `npx playwright install chromium` plus a `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
